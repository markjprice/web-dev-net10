# Errata and Improvements

If you find any mistakes in the second edition, *Real-World Web Development with .NET 10*, or if you have suggestions for improvements, then please [raise an issue in this repository](https://github.com/markjprice/web-dev-net10/issues) or email me at markjprice (at) gmail.com.

[**Errata** (7 items)](errata.md): Typos, tool user interface and behavior changes, or mistakes in code that would cause a compilation error that prevents a successful build.

[**Improvements** (1 item)](improvements.md): Changes to text or code that would improve the content. These are optional.

[**Common Mistakes**](https://github.com/markjprice/markjprice/blob/main/articles/common-mistakes.md): These are some of the most common mistakes that a reader might encounter when trying to get code in book tasks to work, or when trying to write your own code. (Links to the `markjprice` shared articles repository.)

All errata and improvements will be included in the next edition.
